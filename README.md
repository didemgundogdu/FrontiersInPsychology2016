Data is presented in two files: Data_IR_WithNewLabels.Csv and survey data: survey_with_traits_date.csv
In the Infrared(IR) dataset interactions are recorded if receiving badge’s IR within the transmitting badge’s IR signal cone of height h <= 1 meter and a radius of r <= htanθ, where θ = 15◦ degrees; the infrared transmission rate
(TRir) was set to 1Hz.\cite{Alshamsi, Aamena, et al. "Beyond contagion: Reality mining reveals complex patterns of social influence." PloS one 10.8 (2015): e0135740.}
